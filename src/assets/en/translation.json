Now, I'm onto a new adventure that is web development. That desire arose when I became a Bitcoin enthusiast and started to grasp the power of the Blockchain, which made me curious of coding. From there, I attended a +460 hours coding bootcamp for web development. I am now ready and eager to land my first job. Hopefully, you will be the one who will give me that opportunity. And you won't regret it!",
